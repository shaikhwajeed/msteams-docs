# Build apps for Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams apps bring key information, common tools, and trusted processes to where people increasingly gather, learn, and work.

Apps are how you extend Teams to fit your needs. Create something brand new for Teams or integrate an existing app.

## What are Teams apps?

Teams apps are a combination of [capabilities](concepts/capabilities-overview.md) and [entry points](concepts/extensibility-points.md). For example, people can chat with your app's *bot* (capability) in a *channel* (entry point).

Some apps are simple (send notifications), while others are complex (manage patient records). When planning your app, remember that Teams is a collaboration hub. The best Teams apps help people express themselves and work better together.

### Tabs

**Get information more conveniently**: Sometimes you just need to make things easier to find. Display an important webpage in a [tab](tabs/what-are-tabs.md), which provides a full-screen web experience for static and dynamic content in Teams.

### Bots - Test

**Turn words into actions**: Conversations often result in the need to do something (generate an order, review my code, check ticket status, and so on). A [bot](bots/what-are-bots.md) can kick off these kinds of workflows right inside Teams.

### Messaging extensions

**Make it easier to multitask**: With [messaging extensions](messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions.md), you can quickly share external information in a conversation. You also can act on a message, such as creating a help ticket based on the content of a channel post.

### Webhooks

**Communicate with external apps**: [Incoming webhooks](webhooks-and-connectors/what-are-webhooks-and-connectors.md#incoming-webhooks) are a simple way to automatically send notifications from another app to a Teams channel. With [outgoing webhooks](webhooks-and-connectors/what-are-webhooks-and-connectors.md#outgoing-webhooks), message your web service with an @mention.

### Microsoft Graph for Teams

**Utilize Teams data**: The [Microsoft Graph API for Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/teams-concept-overview) provides access to information about teams, channels, users, and messages that can help you create or enhance features for your app.

## Integrate with Teams

Blend the features users love about an existing web app, service, or system with the collaborative features of Teams.
